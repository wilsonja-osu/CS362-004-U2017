BUG NUMBER: 0001
-----------------

Title: Incorrect number of player cards after playing Adventurer (Part 1)

Class: Game rule-breaking bug

Date: 8/3/2017 
Reported By: Jacob Wilson
Email: wilsjaco@oregonstate.edu   


Product: dominion.c
Platform: flip.engr.oregonstate.edu        

Is it reproducible: Yes

Description
===========
After the Adventurer card is played, the player has two additional
cards in their hand. In testing, after the Adventurer card was played,
the player had 8 cards in their hand when they should have had only 6.


Steps to Produce/Reproduce
--------------------------
1) start a game of Dominion
2) have a player play the Adventurer card
3) the number of cards in their hand after play will be incorrect


Expected Results
----------------
Player should gain two cards and discard one (played Adventurer card).
If they start with 5 cards, they should have 6 after play (5 + 2 - 1 = 6).


Actual Results
--------------
The player has 8 cards after play.


Workarounds
-----------
The game still works, but it is breaking the rules of the game. There is
no way to adjust the number of cards in their hand manually.


Other Information
-----------------
It appears that this bug has two parts: first, there is no discard in the
card function where there should be. This is responsible for the player
having one additional card. See Bug #0002 for the second part.

Other Information
-----------------
The second bug related to Bug #1: a while-loop in the card function is
supposed to run until the player gains two Treasure cards, however, it
is clear that this loop is running until three cards are gained. This
second bug results in the player having a second additional card.

Title: Incorrect number of player cards after playing Smithy

Class: Game rule-breaking bug

Date: 8/3/2017

Email: wilsjaco@oregonstate.edu   


Product: dominion.c
Platform: flip.engr.oregonstate.edu        

Is it reproducible: Yes

Description
===========
After the Smithy card is played, the player has one additional card in
their hand. In testing, after the Smithy card was played, the player
had 8 cards in their hand when they should have had only 7.


Steps to Produce/Reproduce
--------------------------
1) start a game of Dominion
2) have a player play the Smithy card
3) the number of cards in their hand after play will be incorrect


Expected Results
----------------
Player should gain three cards and discard one (played Smithy card).
If they start with 5 cards, they should have 7 after play (5 + 3 - 1 = 7).


Actual Results
--------------
The player has 8 cards after play.


Workarounds
-----------
The game still works, but it is breaking the rules of the game. There is
no way to adjust the number of cards in their hand manually.


Other Information
-----------------
This bug appears to be due to a for-loop that runs one iteration too many.
The for-loop is supposed to be set so that the player draws three cards, but
it appears to be set to allow the player to draw four cards. This is why the
player ends up with too many cards.

BUG NUMBER: 0004

Title: Incorrect number of actions after playing Village

Class: Game rule-breaking bug

Date: 8/3/2017 
Reported By: Jacob Wilson
Email: wilsjaco@oregonstate.edu   


Product: dominion.c
Platform: flip.engr.oregonstate.edu        

Is it reproducible: Yes

Description
===========
After the Village card is played, the player has one additional available
action. In testing, after the Village card was played, the player had four
actions available when they should have had only three.


Steps to Produce/Reproduce
--------------------------
1) start a game of Dominion
2) have a player play the Village card
3) the number of actions in the game state will be incorrect


Expected Results
----------------
Player should gain two actions.


Actual Results
--------------
The player gained three actions after play.


Workarounds
-----------
The game still works, but it is breaking the rules of the game. There is
no way to adjust the number of actions manually.


Other Information
-----------------
This bug appears to be caused by how the actions are increased in the Village card
function. The player should only gain two actions, however, it is clear in the code
that the player will gain three actions since the action variable is increased by 3.
